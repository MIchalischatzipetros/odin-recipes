</p>


<p>
    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>2 kilos pork</li>
    <li>50 g seed oil</li>
    <li>50 g olive oil</li>
    <li>1-2 tablespoon(s) mustard</li>
    <li>50 g vinegar, white wine</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon(s) cumin</li>
    <li>2 tablespoon(s) salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoon(s) paprika, sweet</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon(s) chili flakes</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon(s) pepper </li>
    <li>50 g honey</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon(s) garlic, powder or 3 cloves of garlic</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon(s) onion, powder or 1 onion into slices</li>
    <li>2 tablespoon(s) oregano</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
    <h2> Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Cut the meat into thin slices. Tenderize the meat with a mallet to soften the slices, make them very thin, and set them aside. </li>
        <li> In a bowl add the seed oil, olive oil, mustard, vinegar, cumin, salt, paprika, chili flakes, pepper, honey, garlic, onion, oregano, and mix. </li>
        <li> Put the meat into the bowl with the marinade and mix well. Ideally, you should refrigerate it, covered with plastic wrap, for 12 hours. </li>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) set to fan. </li>
        <li> Cut a potato in half and thread the pieces onto 2 wooden skewers. Put them in a baking pan, with the cut side facing down. The potato will be the base for the gyros. Thread the pork slices, one by one, onto the skewers.</li>
        <li> Cut the tomato into slices, the pepper into pieces, and the onion into four pieces. Thread the veggies onto the skewers, above the gyros. 
        <li> Wrap with aluminum foil and bake for 3 hours. Uncover and bake for another 30-40 minutes until golden brown. </li>
    </ol>
    <h2> To serve </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Cut the gyros that is baked and golden all around, and set it aside. You can put the rest of the gyros back in the oven to turn golden where it is cut.</li>
        <li> Divide the tzatziki sauce among the pitas, along with the mustard, the tomato into slices, the onion into slices, the parsley, the French fries, and serve.</li>
